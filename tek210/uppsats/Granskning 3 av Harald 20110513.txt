JONATHANS DEL (PATENT AND COPYRIGHT)

where to develop a new banking system there is several kinds of legal protection
IS -> ARE

options is considered for the major parts of the banking system.
IS -> ARE

There is mainly four different forms of protection that applies to a banking
IS -> ARE

Copyright is of highest importance for a banking system since the
IS -> ARE

nking system have parts of itself exposed to the public, easily
HAVE -> HAS

Names, logotypes, slogans and the like uses another protection, trademarks.
AND SIMILAR THINGS, USES -> USE

Here isn’t anything special for a banking system to consider here
HERE -> THERE, ISN'T ANYTHING -> IS NOTHING

Even functions that is visible on the web front-end can the protected
IS -> ARE

functions that is visible on the web front
IS -> ARE

only give a visual representation
GIVE -> GIVES

representation of the function and gets input from the user, then everything is actually executed on the server
OMFORMULERA. EVERYTHING IS THEN EXECUTED ON THE SERVER

to another customers bank account
CUSTOMER'S

so not all customers need to belong to the same bank
SO THAT NOT

There is one tricky thing that is less obvious whether it can be protected by trade secrets
WHEATHER OR NOT

similar things banks issues to their customers for making logging in more secure
THINGS -> CUSTOMER

Even though the trade secret laws says
SAYS -> SAY

that if one have taken reasonable measures to protect the information one
HAVE -> HAS

Even though the trade secret laws
says that if one have taken reasonable measures to protect
the information one have legal right against the offender, it is
not recommended to rely on this in this case. This since trade
secrets not might be protected against reverse engineering. You
can of course have all the ones receiving the device sign a
license stating that they are not allowed to reverse engineer to
device, but it seems like patent is a more viable option here
BEHÖVER OMFORMULERING.

this there exists a few patents
EXISTS -> EXIST

patents exist that covers secure log in using
COVERS -> COVER

between different kind of systems.
KIND -> KINDS

the new system doesn’t copy what is patented
IS ALREADY PATENTED

or to get hold of a license for the patented solution.
AND IN THAT CASE TO GET HOLD OF A LICENSE

Besides patent and copyright there is also other things thatcan lead
PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, THERE ARE ALSO
